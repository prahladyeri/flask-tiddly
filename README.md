## What is tiddly

`tiddly` is a minimal, prototype RESTful server app for basic CRUD transactions. It is database agnostic and uses `sqlalchemy` on the backend to talk to RDBMS. The database is `sqlite` by default, but you can switch to anything you want by making this small change in the `models.py` file:

	#TODO: Change as needed:
	engine = create_engine("sqlite:///tiddly.db", echo=True)
	Base = declarative_base()

## Project Details

You can host this app and use it as your own replacement for any cloud based backend such as `firebase` or `CouchDB` as long as you follow the CRUD based I/O approach. The RESTful methods are versatile and compatible with the data needs of typical Single Page Apps developed in frameworks like `angular`, `backbone` or `ember`. For example:

| Request | url | body | Action |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| GET  	| /books | 		| Get all rows from the books table.| 
| GET  	| /books/1 | 		| Fetch the book record where the `id` field equals `1`.| 
| POST 	| /books | {"name":"Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix."}		| Insert record into books table from posted JSON data.| 
| PUT  	| /books/1 | {"name":"Some new title."}		| Update the record where `id` equals `1` with posted JSON data.| 
| DELETE | /books/1 |	| Delete the record where `id` equals `1`.| 
	
Additional tables like `books` in this example need to be defined in `models.py`. By default, `tiddly` comes with only two tables called `dual` and `user` to play around. Of course, you can customize and change this logic in `app.py` if you really want. There is also the case when the `GET` method that gets all or one row by `id` isn't sufficient and we need advanced fetching using the `where` or `orderby` clauses. For this, I've introduced the `FETCH` http method which does the job:

| Request | url | body                | Action |
| ----- | ----- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| FETCH | /dual | {"where": {"text":"foobar"}} | Fetch all rows from the books table where the text field matches the string "foobar".| 
| FETCH | /user | {"where": {"name":"admin"}, "orderby": "email"} | Fetch all rows from the user table where the name matches "admin" and sort results by email column.| 
| FETCH | /user | {"where": {"name":"admin"}, "orderby": "email desc"} | Fetch all rows from the user table where the name matches "admin" and sort results by email column in descending order.| 
| FETCH | /user | {"where": {"name":"admin"}, "orderby": "email desc", "limit":10, "offset": 2} | Fetch at most 10 rows, starting at offset 2 from the user table where the name matches "admin". Sort results by email column in descending order.| 


## Installation

To install and run this project, just clone or [download](https://github.com/prahladyeri/tiddly/archive/master.zip) this github repository and just start the `tiddly` app:

	python app.py
	
I've tested this on Python 3.6, but it should ideally run on other versions too. Once you run it, you can open your browser and browse the following `url` to make sure its running:

	http://127.0.0.1:5000
	
After that, you can make the following POST request to insert some data into the dual table.

	requests.post('http://localhost:5000/dual', json={"text":"chai and biscuit."})

You can use the accompanying `test.py` or any other tool like `curl` to make these requests. Now, open up the browser again and visit below `url` to list all the records in the `dual` table:

	http://127.0.0.1:5000/dual
	
After running the above command, you should be able to see something like this:

	{
	  "data": [
		{
		  "id": 1, 
		  "text": "chai and biscuit."
		}
	  ], 
	  "status": "success", 
	  "verb": "GET"
	}
	
Note that the app only works with `json` data, so the usual POST requests won't work. Similarly, you can try out other verbs - `PUT` and `DELETE` to update and delete records respectively. To define your own new table, open the `models.py` in a text-editor and define your own class based on the sqlalchemy declarative `Base` class. Write the new class code around the other defined Model classes, for example the `Dual` class:

	class Dual(Base):
		__tablename__ = "dual"
		id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
		text = Column(String)
		
		def repr(self):
			return "<Dual(id=%s, text=%s, )>" % (id, text)
			
Finally, you can also install `tiddly` using `pip` just to play around with:

	pip install tiddly
			
## Feature Roadmap

I intend to add the following features to this template project soon:

- Sorting using `order by` clause (done).
- Pagination.
- Fetching summaries using `group by` clause.
- User sign-in and authentication using session or tokens.

## Stack

`tiddly` is built using the robust `flask` framework and `sqlalchemy` library.
